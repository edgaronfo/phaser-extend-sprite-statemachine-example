###Phaser extend Sprite State Machine Extension

In short, this is an extension of the Sprite class from the Phaser framework which includes an implementation of a state machine for behaviour control.

This is a fork of the phaser extend sprite statemachine example by Adam Roth.

The fork changes the way we initialize the entity, instead of hard-coding the state machine behaviour, we read it from file.
